# Interceptor-Java-Maven-Web

Component programming with the framework JSF. The architectural pattern  "Interceptor" is used here for developing a Java project that uses JSF for asynchronous events handling.

This application objective is to compute the initial velocity of simulated car from an input datum, which is captured with a html form, afterwards to install an event handler that reacts when the user cliks one of the two programmed buttons: "On" ("Encender") and "Accelerate" ("Acelerar").

  The solution of this exercise must be delivered and it has to be done according to the following requirements:

-Initially, the main panel label shows the text "APAGADO" ("OFF")  and the button labels, the name of each button.

The "Encender" ("On") button has to be a common Swing button that changes the color and the displayed text "Encender"/"Apagar" ("On"/"Off") inside the button when it is clicked.

When the "Acelerar" ("Accelerate") button is clicked, a label "ACELERANDO" ( "ACCELERATING")  is displayed on the main panel, but only if the car motor is "On" or otherwise it does not attend the user click. On clicking the button with the label "Off" now, the label on the main panel will return to show the initial text "OFF".
